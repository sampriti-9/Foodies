# BigHungers Food Ordering Frontend - React, Express.js MERN Project

---

BigHungers frontend is a modern, responsive, and feature-rich React application for food ordering. It connects seamlessly to the backend API, providing users with a smooth experience for browsing restaurants, searching by city/cuisine, managing carts, placing orders, and tracking order status in real time. Built with Vite, React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, shadcn/ui, React Query, and Auth0, it is modular, scalable, and easy to extend or reuse in other projects.

## Key Components

- `Header`, `Footer`, `MainNav`, `MobileNav`, `UsernameMenu`: Navigation and layout
- `SearchBar`, `CityDropdown`, `CuisineFilter`, `SortOptionDropdown`: Search/filter UI
- `RestaurantInfo`, `MenuItem`, `OrderSummary`, `OrderItemCard`: Restaurant/menu/order display
- `CheckoutButton`, `LoadingButton`: Actions and feedback
- `OrderStatusHeader`, `OrderStatusDetail`: Order tracking
- `PaginationSelector`: Pagination controls
- `ui/`: shadcn/ui and Radix UI-based primitives (button, card, dialog, etc.)

---

## Pages & Routing

- `/` â€” Home page, search/filter restaurants
- `/detail/:restaurantId` â€” Restaurant detail, menu, add to cart
- `/order-status` â€” User order status/history
- `/manage-restaurant` â€” Owner dashboard (manage restaurant/menu/orders)
- `/user-profile` â€” User profile
- `/auth-callback` â€” Auth0 login callback

Routing is handled by React Router v6 in `AppRoutes.tsx`.

---

## API Integration

- All API calls are managed via React Query hooks in `src/api/`
- Uses `VITE_API_BASE_URL` from `.env` for backend URL
- Authenticated requests use Auth0 access tokens
- Handles errors and loading states with toasts and spinners

---

## Environment Variables (.env)

Create a `.env` file in the root of `food-ordering-frontend/` with:

```env
VITE_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:7001 # or your deployed backend URL
VITE_AUTH0_DOMAIN=your-auth0-domain
VITE_AUTH0_CLIENT_ID=your-auth0-client-id
VITE_AUTH0_AUDIENCE=your-auth0-audience
VITE_AUTH0_CALLBACK_URL=http://localhost:5173/auth-callback # or your deployed frontend URL
```

- Get Auth0 values from your Auth0 dashboard (Applications > SPA)
- Set VITE_API_BASE_URL to your backend's base URL

---

## How to Run

1. **Install dependencies:**

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. **Set up your `.env` file** as described above.
3. **Start the dev server:**

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

   - App runs at <http://localhost:5173> by default

4. **Build for production:**

   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

5. **Preview production build:**

   ```bash
   npm run preview
   ```

## Code Snippets & Reusability

### Example: Using an API Hook

```tsx
import { useGetMyOrders } from "@/api/OrderApi";
const { orders, isLoading } = useGetMyOrders();
```

### Example: Protected Route

```tsx
import ProtectedRoute from "@/auth/ProtectedRoute";
<Route
  path="/user-profile"
  element={
    <ProtectedRoute>
      <UserProfilePage />
    </ProtectedRoute>
  }
/>;
```

### Example: Custom Button (shadcn/ui)

```tsx
import { Button } from "@/components/ui/button";
<Button onClick={handleClick}>Click me</Button>;
```

- All components are modular and can be reused in other React projects
- UI primitives (button, card, etc.) are based on shadcn/ui and Radix UI
- API hooks are decoupled and easy to adapt
